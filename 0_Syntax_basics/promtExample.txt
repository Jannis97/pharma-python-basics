i want that you create an new .py file that loads the first csv and prcocesses it.
In the file is an noisy chromatography data.  multiple differed with peaks.

Load the data same like befor.  use the savitzky golay filter with = 11 for smoothing the data. Find the largest k = 17 peaks.

use the maxima and fit 12 gaussians so that the sum of gaussians is similar to the processed data.

Create an subplots, with original,  with filtered data with peaks marked, and the fittet gaussians and ther sum.
First create an optimized promt, and then all code in one, do not use parse args

Create an second subplots for the individual gaussians and the sum of gaussians.Save both plots as png files.

Do not correct the baseline do all in one
